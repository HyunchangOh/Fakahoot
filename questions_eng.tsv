Which of the following statements best describes Deep Learning?	A subfield of Machine Learning.	A family of techniques that exclusively uses biological neurons for computations.	A method that focuses exclusively on supervised learning algorithms.	A subfield of Artificial Intelligence that is based on rule-based systems.
What inspired early researchers to develop Artificial Neural Networks?	Biological neural networks.	The principles of symbolic logic.	Mathematical probability theories.	The design of traditional computer hardware.
What is a potential problem when using Black-Box models in medical diagnostics?	Physicians might not be able to justify decisions based on these models due to their lack of transparency.	They are unable to process medical data.	They make human supervision unnecessary.	They always deliver false-positive results.
What are the three main layers in the architecture of an Artificial Neural Network?	Input layer, Hidden layers, and an Output layer.	Neuron layer, Weight layer, and Synapse layer.	Input layer, Summation function layer, and Activation function layer.	Dendrite layer, Soma layer, and Axon layer.
What role do weights play in Artificial Neural Networks?	To represent the importance of inputs for the node.	To process signals received from dendrites.	To control the output of the activation function.	To transmit signals from one node to another.
What distinguishes deep neural networks (Deep Neural Networks) from shallow Artificial Neural Networks (Shallow Neural Networks)?	The inclusion of more than just a few hidden layers.	The presence of biological components.	The exclusive use of supervised learning techniques.	The use of an activation function.
How are transparency and explainability related in the context of AI systems?	Transparency means that the entire decision-making process is fully traceable. Explainability refers to the fact that the essential influencing factors of a single decision can be made understandable.	Transparency and explainability essentially describe the same thing.	Explainability means that the behavior is fully traceable, transparency that for a specific individual decision the essential influencing factors can be shown	Transparency is the opposite of explainability. An explainable system can explain its decisions, but is then no longer transparent, i.e., how the decision came about remains hidden
Which of the following statements best describes forward propagation in the context of Artificial Neural Networks?	Forwarding input data through the layers of the network to calculate the output.	Dividing the data into training and test sets for validation.	The process of adjusting weights and biases to minimize error.	Calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network.
Backpropagation is a procedure used in...	training Artificial Neural Networks.	dividing datasets into training and test data.	creating clusters in unlabeled data.	sorting datasets in a database.
What is an essential characteristic of Black-Box models?	They are opaque in their decision-making processes.	They are only used for small datasets and simple architectures.	They are simple and easy to interpret.	They provide clear explanations for their decision-making processes.
