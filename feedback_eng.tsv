Deep Learning	Deep Learning is indeed a subarea of machine learning, that was inspired by biological neurons.	AI Across Domains - Competencies for the AI Age (WiSe25/26)
Artificial Neural Networks	Although a lot of different technologies laid the foundation for artificial neural networks, their core structure is inspired from biological neurons, hence the name 'neural networks.'	https://giphy.com/gifs/harvard-brain-neuron-9N2UvCx7wXLnG
Black Box Models	Black Box Models can sometimes be super accurate, but their decision process and reasoning behind their decisions is not interpretable.	Evilaicartoons. Terminology: Black Box.

Artificial Neural Networks	The three layers are input, hidden, and output layers. Hidden layer is called 'hidden' because unlike 'input' and 'output', it has no direct contact with the world outside of the neural network.	Sarker, Iqbal H.

Weights	Weights are multiplied to each input to a neuron, before they are all added together. Weights represent the importance of each input for the activation of that neuron (or node).

Deep Neural Networks	The more layers the neural network has, the deeper it becomes!	Sarker, Iqbal H.

Transparency and Explainability	Transparency means that people can understand how an AI system is developed, trained, operated, and deployed in a specific application context - for example, so that consumers can make more informed decisions about whether to use it. Explainability, by contrast, refers to the ability of affected individuals to understand how exactly a specific output or decision of the AI system was produced.	The Guardian. (2024, October 18).

Forward Propagation	In forward propagation, input data is passed through the neural network to generate an output. After the network generates an output, it is compared with the actual result - that is, the error.	AI Across Domains - Competencies for the AI Age (WiSe25/26)
Backpropagation	Backpropagation is an algorithm used to train feedforward neural networks. It is an iterative method that adjusts the network's weight parameters by computing the gradient of an error function. First, an error value is calculated for each output unit, i.e., the difference between the actual value and the predicted value. This error is then propagated backward through the network - from the output layer to the input layer. During this backward pass, the weights are modified in such a way that the error is reduced in future predictions. In this way, the network gradually learns to make more accurate predictions.
